# Objective

Insurance companies rely on accurate premium prediction to optimize pricing strategies and minimize risk. To address this, I developed a Machine Learning model to predict insurance premium amounts based on various customer attributes, leveraging advanced data analysis and model optimization techniques.



## About the Project
--> This project was part of the Kaggle Playground Series Competition (Dec 2024 Edition), focusing on predicting insurance premiums based on structured tabular data.

--> Developed a Machine Learning model to predict premium amounts, trained on a dataset of 1,20,000 data points.
Conducted feature engineering and extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to extract meaningful insights.

--> Implemented and evaluated multiple regression models, including XGBRegressor, LightGBM, CatBoost, and HistGradientBoostingRegressor, ensuring model reliability through cross-validation and achieving an RMSLE score of 1.04727.

--> Utilized model ensembling to combine the strengths of individual models, further optimizing predictions and improving the RMSLE to 1.04651.

## Dataset
The dataset includes various customer attributes, such as:

Age,
Gender,
Annual Income,
Marital Status,
Credit Score,
Vehicle Age,
Policy Type,
Previous Claims,
Health Score

The data has been cleaned, preprocessed, and analyzed to enhance model performance.
